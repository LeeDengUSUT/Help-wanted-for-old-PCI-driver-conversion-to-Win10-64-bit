# Help-wanted-for-old-PCI-driver-conversion-to-Win10-64-bit
We have an old 32-bit PCI bus driver created in 2003 for TI's chip TMS32C6415EGLZ6E3. We have the source code written in C++ by ATEME in Fance, and it requires Compuware SoftICE and Windows DDK to compile. We would like to convert it to Windows 10 64-bit driver. Please contact me if you are capable to do this job. Thanks!
